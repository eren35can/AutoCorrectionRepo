# AutoCorrectionRepo

•	Composite Design Pattern is applied.

Suppose you are developing a text editing application which is composed of components that are also responsible of editing a text. 
Components will:
1.	Take text input from user and save it into a file
2.	Perform automatic text correction of a given text
3.	Count number of paragraph, line, word, and characters of a given text .
4.	Search, list, and count the words containing inputted characters (like CTRL+F command) in a given text. 
For example, when the user enters “ck” characters, the output will be “back, slack” words in the given text.

Text could be given both through user input from console or through a file.  
The given jar file is a changed version of the project in the given link.
